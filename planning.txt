Splitting up the tasks:
-do backgrounds --Ben
-do font bitmaps --Deo
-do main menu screen and stuff --Ben (play, multipl, highscore list)
-do interrupts, decide on interrupt priorities --Ben
-do an update_display() - i wanna see score increase, coins, whatever //together on sunday
-do main character cube --BEN
-do player movements (still cube, move up-down, mirrors bg) --BEN
-do generating trains --Deo
-do coin generation --Deo
-do collision-detection (matrix having stuff)  //together tuesday afternoon
-do sprites --Deo
-do speedup, level increasement over time
-do UART multipl. //by friday 

-do the rest, playtesting, optional stuffs whatevs

additional tasks:
-make the display_sprite function inf parameter be able to decide if the sprite should be drawn in transperant or opaque mode, 
    meaning if it should only set the bits declared as 1 if transparent or all bits if opaque.
-do the collision detection using a seperate 2d array containing hitboxes, the hitboxes will have to be small than the sprites
     in some cases because animations were not made considering pixel by pixel comparisons.
     e.g. when rolling the character anim frame is not small enough to fit without overlap through the hole of a barrier.
-do fix the xOffset parameter of the display_sprite function - it doesnt seem to work.
